# Idea of the Project

A robotics dog is a type of robot that combines the fields of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and software engineering to create a realistic and functional canine-like machine. The mechanical section of the dog would involve designing and building the physical structure of the robot, including the body, limbs, and tail. The electrical section would involve the integration of electronic components such as sensors, motors, and power systems to control the robot's movement and behavior. The software section would involve the programming and control of the robot's actions, including movements, speech and vision recognition, and decision-making capabilities. All these sections would work together to create a functional and realistic robotic dog that can perform various tasks, such as assisting with household tasks, providing companionship, or even assisting in search and rescue operations.

# More In Depth

- Software
  - Use computer vision to detect color to determine different objects of color
  - Dectect objects such as 2D and/or 3D object 
  - Determine the distance of an object
  - If possible create an algorithm to find the main host and follow the host using computer vision (host must use distinct color or a local node such as a esp32 or pico w)
  - Control all servo motors with limiting of degree
- Mechanical
  - Determine what type of filament for the final product
  - Determine what type of [infill patterns](https://all3dp.com/2/cura-infill-patterns-all-you-need-to-know/)
  - What type of leg (how many degree of freedom)
  - Limit the weight of the dog between 10 to 25 pounds
  - Determine the environment the dog will be in
    - Terrain
    - Environment weather, temperature, and humidity
  - Traction for the feet
    - What material
  - Plastic casing for outside environment or possibly falling down 
    - weight
    - Density
  - Dimension of the dog
- Electrical
  - Electrical components for the dog
    - Batteries
    - Voltage regulator
    - servo's
    - camera
    - wiring
  - Temperature management
  - Airflow
  - Simple and Unique design
  - May use a raspberry pi board, pynq board, or nano jetson
  - How to save enough power 
  

### Electrical Point of View

One of the main issues will be the batteries due to how much power is needed and the amount of batteries to make a dog function for a while.
