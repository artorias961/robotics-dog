# Idea of the Project

Make a robotics dog that can walk on simple terrian such as carpets or tiles while following a person. Where the entire design will have a load between 10 - 20 pounds and 2 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) per leg. The dog will main purpose is to be an interior pet due to control envirnment for version 1. The second version will considered outside elements such as Rain, obstacles on the ground, and crowded environment. Futhermore, the dog may contain the following: camera's, batteries, shocks absorbers, servo motors, voltage regulator, traction components, and plastic filament.

### Electrical Point of View

One of the main issues will be the batteries due to how much power is needed and the amount of batteries to make a dog function for a while. 



### Hardware Point of View
