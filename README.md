# Idea of the Project

This project aims to develop a guided tour robot designed to assist individuals with disabilities in navigating the California State University, Los Angeles campus. The robot will utilize detailed floor plans of campus buildings and follow a pre-set route. It will be equipped with advanced computer vision technology to detect and avoid obstacles, enhancing safe navigation. Key features include:

1. Diverse Sensor Array: The robot will employ a variety of sensors like LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, cameras, IR proximity sensors, and a GPS module. These tools will gather essential data about the environment, aiding in the robot's localization and obstacle detection.

2. Internal Monitoring Sensors: Internally, the robot will have Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), position sensors, load sensors, and current sensors. These will monitor the robot's status and ensure smooth operation.

3. Microcontroller and Processor Integration: The gathered sensor data will be processed by microcontrollers, which in turn feed into a central microprocessor. This setup allows for efficient data handling and control.

4. Operating System and Control Software: Ubuntu will be the operating system to manage high-level algorithms. The control software programmed into the system will execute precise commands, directing the robot's movements.

5. Actuation System: The robot's movement will be controlled by various motors, including servo, stepper, and brushless motors. This setup ensures a wide range of motion and adaptability to different terrains.

6. Power Management: Electronic subsystems will be implemented to power the motors and regulate the overall power supply, ensuring consistent and efficient energy usage.

7. Structural Design: The robot's exterior will primarily consist of 3D-printed components, supported by a robust, load-bearing internal frame. This design ensures durability while remaining lightweight for ease of maneuverability.

This tour robot is specially designed to make the Cal State LA campus more accessible to people with disabilities, offering a reliable and safe way to explore and navigate the university's facilities.
